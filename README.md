# ai-peer-mentoring-connector
‚ú® About The Project
Many educational institutions struggle with manual and ineffective peer-mentoring programs. The matching process is often superficial, leading to poor chemistry and low engagement.

ConnectSphere AI solves this by providing an intelligent, automated solution. By analysing a mentee's specific academic needs, goals, and learning preferences, our algorithm identifies and suggests the most compatible mentors, fostering a more effective and supportive learning environment.

This prototype demonstrates the core matching concept using a clean user interface and a simulated backend logic.

üöÄ Key Features
ü§ñ AI-Powered Matching (Simulated): A scoring system ranks mentors based on compatibility across subjects, goals, and teaching styles.

üéØ Goal-Oriented Profiles: Mentees can specify exactly what they need help with, from exam prep to understanding core concepts.

üé® Clean, Responsive UI: A modern and intuitive interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring accessibility on any device.

‚ö° Instant Feedback: Get your top 3 mentor matches in seconds.

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
This prototype is built with fundamental web technologies.

HTML5

CSS3 (with custom properties for theming)

JavaScript (ES6+)

The proposed full-stack application would be built with:

Frontend: React.js or Vue.js

Backend: Node.js (Express.js) or Python (Django)

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB

AI/ML: Python with Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for the matching model.
